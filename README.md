# Inverted-Index
Inverted Index is a data structure which is used in information retrieval systems.
Inverted Index basically consists of 2 things:
a) Dictionary : Which stores [word:count]
b) Postings: Which stores [term: [index of docs]]

Given a list of documents, you can create a inverted index of documents, such that when a query is fired at the Retrieval System, your collection of docs can quickly retreive where the given query exists or not in the information.(Concept called as Boolean Retrieval)

The following project is developed in IntelliJ framework and Java language.
